This repository is a collection of Solidity smart contracts built as part of my blockchain development journey.
Each task is a self-contained project focusing on a key concept in Ethereum smart contracts.

📂 Projects
🏦 Task 1 – Simple Bank

A basic smart contract that allows users to deposit and withdraw Ether.

💰 Task 2 – Token System

A simple ERC20-like token system with balances and transfer functionality.

🗳️ Task 3 – Polling System

A decentralized polling and voting system where users can create polls, vote once, and check results.

🔒 Task 4 – Personal Portfolio (Crypto Locking)

A smart contract that allows users to lock Ether for a time period and withdraw only after unlock.
